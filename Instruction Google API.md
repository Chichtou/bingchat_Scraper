To fill the JSON file with API credentials, you will need to create a service account for Google Sheets and download the credentials in JSON format. Here's a step-by-step guide to do it:

Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project and Enable Google Sheets API
Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project (or use an existing one).

In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard."

Click on the "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button.

Search for "Google Sheets API" and click on it.

Click the "Enable" button to enable the Google Sheets API for your project.

Step 2: Create a Service Account
In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."

Click on the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button and choose "Service account."

Enter a name for the service account and optionally add a description.

Choose a role for the service account. For Google Sheets access, the "Editor" role is sufficient. You can also limit the scope to specific APIs if needed.

Click the "Continue" button.

Skip the "Grant this service account access to the project" step (you can do this later).

Click on the "+ CREATE KEY" button and choose the JSON key type.

Click the "Create" button, and the JSON file containing the credentials will be downloaded to your computer.

Step 3: Share Google Sheets with the Service Account
Open the Google Sheets document you want to access with the service account.

Click on the "Share" button in the top right corner.

Enter the email address of the service account (it can be found in the JSON file under the client_email field).

Grant the necessary permissions to the service account (e.g., "Editor" access).

Step 4: Fill the JSON File in the Project
Open the JSON file you downloaded in a text editor.

Copy the entire content of the JSON file, including the curly braces and all the keys and values.

Create a new file in your project directory (where the Python script is located) and name it something like credentials.json.

Paste the JSON content into the credentials.json file and save it.

Step 5: Update the Code
In the Python script, there is a line that loads the credentials from the JSON file:


`creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name("credentials.json", scope)`


Make sure that the credentials.json file is in the same directory as the Python script or provide the correct path to the file in the from_json_keyfile_name() function.

With these steps completed, your Python script will be able to authenticate with Google Sheets using the credentials stored in the credentials.json file, and you'll be able to read and write data to the Google Sheet associated with the service account.
